## 📊 Dataset

* **Source**: The dataset is based on the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.

* **Features**:

  * CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
  * ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for large lots
  * INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
  * CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
  * NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
  * RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
  * AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
  * DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
  * RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
  * TAX: full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000
  * PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
  * B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
  * LSTAT: % lower status of the population
  * MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in \$1000's (Target variable)

## 🧠 Model Overview

* **Algorithm**: Multiple Linear Regression
* **Libraries Used**:

  * pandas
  * numpy
  * scikit-learn
  * matplotlib
  * seaborn
* **Model Persistence**: The trained model is saved using `joblib` for future predictions.([GitHub][1], [GitHub][2], [GitHub][3])

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* pip

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saumyasundaram23/Real-Estate-Price-Prediction.git
   cd Real-Estate-Price-Prediction
   ```



2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```



*Note: If `requirements.txt` is not present, manually install the required libraries:*

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn joblib
```



3. **Run the training script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```



This will train the model and save it as `Dragon.joblib`.

4. **Use the model for predictions**:

   Open and run the `Model Usage.ipynb` notebook to see how to load the trained model and make predictions.

## 📈 Results

The model achieves a reasonable accuracy in predicting housing prices. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are available in the `Dragon Real Estates.ipynb` notebook.

## 📌 Key Takeaways

* Understanding and implementing Multiple Linear Regression.
* Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.
* Model evaluation and interpretation.
* Saving and loading machine learning models using `joblib`.
